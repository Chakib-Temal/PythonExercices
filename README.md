# Work4 Interviews

You'll find the base iPython Notebooks to work from in the `exercises` folder. Feel free to use the internet, but any code you submit must be your own. Focus on the parts that you are comfortable with!

## Installation

Download `Python 3.7` and `Jupyter`, for instance on Mac using `homebrew`:

    # Install Homebrew, see https://brew.sh
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    # Install `python3.7`, see https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python
    brew install python
    # Install `jupyter`
    pip install jupyter
    # Run Jupyter
    jupyter notebook

Finally, open the url that is displayed by `jupyter`, and navigate to the notebooks in this repository to start writing code!

## Submission

`Jupyter` will save changes made to the notebooks within the `.ipynb` file. Once done, please send back an archive of
your `exercises` folder via email to `Olivier Le Floch <olefloch@work4labs.com>`.
